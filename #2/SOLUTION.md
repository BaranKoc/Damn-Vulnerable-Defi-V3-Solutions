## What is our mission
There‚Äôs a pool with 1000 ETH in balance, offering flash loans. It has a fixed fee of 1 ETH.

A user has deployed a contract with 10 ETH in balance. It‚Äôs capable of interacting with the pool and receiving flash loans of ETH.

Take all ETH out of the user‚Äôs contract. If possible, in a single transaction.

<br/>

## What are the smart contracts 
- **`NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol`**: smart contract that includes **`flashLoan(...)`** function
- **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`**: smart contract that includes **`onFlashLoan(...)`** function

<br/>


## Solution 

Here **`NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol`** contract's **`flashLoan(...)`** function

([**NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol**](contracts/NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol))

<br/>

Here **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`** contract's **`onFlashLoan(...)`** function

([**FlashLoanReceiver**](#2/contracts/FlashLoanReceiver.sol))

<br/>

The vulnarability cames from,  **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`** contract.

**`onFlashLoan(...)`** function is triggered from `NaiveReceiverLenderPool.sol` when **`flashLoan(...)`** is called.



‚ö†Ô∏è But **`onFlashLoan(...)`** function doesn't check Who has called **`flashLoan(...)`** function.

This means anybody who call **`flashLoan(...)`** function can pass  **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`** contract as a `receiver` paremether to **`flashLoan(...)`** function. This will trigger **`onFlashLoan(...)`** function inside **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`**.

And **`FlashLoanReceiver`** will pay transection fee until be out of money. üò•üò•üò•

But we have send 10 transection. If you want to do this challenge **in single transection** fallow this,

<br/>

## How could this exploit be prevented ?
We want the **sender of the transection** to be equal to **users address**.

first we have to create **new variable** inside **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`** contract named **`owner`**

``` solidity
address private owner;

// Modify the constructor
constructor(address _pool, address _owner) {
        pool = _pool;
        owner = _owner;
    }
```
Than inside **`FlashLoanReceiver.sol`** contract's **`onFlashLoan(...)`** function we will require **`tx.origin`** to be equal to **`owner`**.

``` solidity
function onFlashLoan(...) external returns (bytes32) {

        require(tx.origin != owner, "Wrong sender");

        /...
        /...
        /...
    }
```

## How to test it
got to ‚û°Ô∏è [**Damn Vulnerable Defi - Chalange #2**](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/challenges/2.html). Clone the repository as mentioned and,

put [**basic solution code**](Basic.Solution.md) to his place 

/or

put [**single transection solution code**](Single.Transection.Solution.md) to his place

Then you can just type **`npm run naive-receiver`**
